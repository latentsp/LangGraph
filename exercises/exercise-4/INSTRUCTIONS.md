Use `chat_collect_template` to build a chat agent that will help you collect the following project information:

1️⃣ **Title**  
2️⃣ **Budget**  
3️⃣ **Timeline**  
4️⃣ **Description**  

🔄 If the user doesn't provide the required information, keep track of the number of failed attempts.  
🚨 Once the user fails to provide valid input **3 times** for any field, the graph should **END** and stop collecting information.

✨ Make sure your agent is friendly and clear in its prompts!
